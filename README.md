# Minesweeper

This is my Pygame interpretation of the classic Windows game Minesweeper.

## Game Rules
1. The first click is a freebie, you won't ever click on a mine.

2. The numbers displayed on each tile show the number of mines adjacent to it in a 3x3 grid. <br/>

3. Right-click to place a flag over suspected mine locations. In order to win, you must clear all tiles except for the ones containing mines.   

## How to play
The easiest way to play is on [repl.it](https://repl.it/talk/share/Minesweeper/84316). There is a game cheat if you need help, but you'll have to figure it out. I also recommend changing the repl.it window size to improve your game play experience.         

The alternative approach has a better UI and gameplay experience but requires the following steps:
1. Please install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Please install the latest version of PyGame by typing the following into your console: `python3 -m pip install pygame`
If you have trouble installing PyGame, please visit PyGame's [Getting Started](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) page.   
3. Download the Minesweeper files onto your desktop.  
4. Open up your console and change directories to the Minesweeper file folder.   
5. Type `python3 Minesweeper.py` into the console and begin playing.
